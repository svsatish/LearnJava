        Variable - Container to store values. Variable values will change during runtime.
        Datatype - Type of data the variable holds.
        Java is Statically type language meaning variable should be explicitly declared and assigned before being used.

        There are 2 types of datatypes
        1. Primitive - Predefined/Language defined - 8 datatypes
        - Primitive datatypes are immutable - once assigned they cannot be changed.
        - There will be no methods for primitive datatypes meaning no operations.
        2. Non-Primitive - String, Collections etc
